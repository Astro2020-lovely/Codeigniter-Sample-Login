How are you, today?
For this issue, I can provide you the correct situation with evidence.
First, this project is to do auction his Polish products from Ebay to Alibaba.
Er, I guess his current complaints are 2 problems such as no submission of project and unresponsiveness.
But both complaints are very very unfair and these complaints are fake.
I will explain to you in detail about the situation, now.
At the first time, both of us agreed for this project with 300$ USD budget.
And I get released 2 milestones (300$) when I delivered him the project via freelancer chatting box.
You can see the attached file, then you will be sure that the project is already delivered.
But first, although the project was delivered, he can not do the auction with this project for now.
Because of his seller account's problem.
They are closing and are changing their accounts info of Ebay and Alibaba.
As you know, for doing auction, this project is using the API access info of these accounts.
To be honest and to be true, this problem is just his , because I am chinese and I can't handle the polish account and he is unique owner of these accounts.
So he must prepare the correct account in Ebay and Alibaba.
I don't know if he is trying about that.
Second, at the time of this problem occurred, he told me if i can handle this problem, he will add the extra money(100$ milestone).
So i told him "let me try with my best", but this words was not for the money.
This is not our project step and couldn't be project step.
Because I am not a Polish seller of Ebay.
Also that extra milestone was not created and released yet.
So really he has no right to require fairly due to this problem.
To solving this problem is only my trying as a human for him.
Like recommedation.
If he add it, the total project budget will be 400$.
But as you can see on the payment processing, only the 300$ was released, this is only first-contracted budget.
But he is asking me, why can't you solve this problem.
So I replyed similar with these words.
"This is very impossible because i can't handle the your seller account.
This permission is unique.
If i access your account, I guess the bot identify my ip, then denying the access or asking to change your account info and sending email to verify your phone or login info again."
Then he says, "that's why I gave you extra 100$".
But as you know well, where is this extra 100$?
Nothing anywhere.
At least he must provide me the correct account(API) info.
But he didn't anything about that yet.
Maybe he is not a real seller there.
After delivering this project i was waiting for him to solve these account issues.
After many days left, I was proceeding my personal problem so I told him about that while he solving his seller account issue. 
So again he has no right to complain about the unresponsiveness.
I already told him my problem after delivering the project and I had to solve my problems while he solves his account issue.
Actually to recommend the solutions is to give the only kind helps to him to solve his seller accounts issues, not contract.
But he is not solving his account issue till now and didn't do it yet.
And about delivering the result, and about my much hard efforts, he is complaining.
I already dedicated my best and best for this project and for him for over 20 days WITHOUT SLEEP.
Currently, his behavior is very unprofessional and unfair.
I think the released milestones are very fair ones for the first contracted project.
I want to get it back.
Also, he is not replying now and will be not any more. 
You can check the attached screenshot as well.
And I think we can't negotiate each other because he is asking me the impossible no-contracted problem always.
I think you support team is a unique fair judge for this problem, so i sincerely hope you will resolve this problem quickly to send me the released milestone back for my hard efforts.
